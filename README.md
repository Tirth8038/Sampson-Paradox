It states that, “The trend or result that appears in several different groups of data but it reverses or disappears when the data is combined.”

As we can see, by splitting the people into Men and Women, the probabilities of Men and Women liking Green Apple flavour increases than Men and Women liking Tropical flavour due to mismatch sample sizes. Such that, P(G/M) > P(T/M)  and P(G|W) > P(T|M) ; where M= Men ,W=Women.
Hence, it can be proved that the probability or result which occurred in the combined dataset reverses when data is split or exists separately.
